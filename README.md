## My process

### Built with:
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS - as framework
- Cors - as a middleware to connect frontend and backend from different ports
- Mongoose - library to create connections between MongoDB and NodeJS
- MongoDB - as Data Base

### What I learned

I used this project to practice about the construction of routes, connection with MongoDB using Mongoose.

### Useful resources
[Mongoose CRUD](https://coursework.vschool.io/mongoose-crud/) - This article helped me a lot with an example of how the put and delete works in mongoose.
